# Rakun
Project in collaboration with graphic designer Radovan Vasak.

## What is Rakun?
Rakun is a fictional music publishing house, whose logo is made up of 146 squares, situated in a 18x18 grid. The logo is made so, that the squares, or rather modules, are able to be exchanged for any other shape. Thus it creates a variable composition, that cites the content, to which the logo refers and is fit for the flexibility of today’s digital world.

## What is Rakun game?
The Rakun game operates in the interface of an iconic Minesweeper game, that one can remember from old Windows devices. The game simulates the original, yet is made to annoy the player as much as possible. The goal of the game is to correctly fill out the logo square by square. In order to win, the player has to correctly click through all of the individual squares and not make a mistake, otherwise they have to start over.
